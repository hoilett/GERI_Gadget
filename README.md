The GERI Gadget is a small smartwatch I made for students taking my Biomedical Instrumentation class during GERI Summer Residential 2018. GERI stands for Gifted Education Resource Institute and it's a wonderful group at Purdue that specializes on educational policy, training, teaching methods, etc. of gifted students in K-12. Check out all their wonderful work on their website: [Purdue GERI](https://www.education.purdue.edu/geri/)


Anyways, my inspiration for the smartwatch was to create a device that students can use to explore . Revision A of the watch contains a few peripherals, namely:
* ATSAMD21 Microcontroller
* On/Off Switch
* Built in LiPo Battery Charging Circuit
* OLED
* Two pushbuttons
* Buzzer
* Photoresistor
* LED
* Accelerometer


_**This section is still under development. I will be filling it out over the next few weeks so bookmark this page and stay tuned!**_

## 1. Assembling the printed circuit board

## 2. Booloading the ATSAMD21

## 3. Programming the Microcontroller
###### **A. Installing the board definitions for SparkFun's SAMD21 Dev Breakout Board**
###### **B. Installing the proper code libraries**
You will need three libraries to get started with the GERI Gadget:
1. Adafruit's SSD1306 Library
2. Adafruit's GFX Library
3. SparkFun's LIS3DH Accelerometer Library
